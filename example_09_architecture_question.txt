Instruction: I want to modify Link's Z-targeting system to allow targeting multiple enemies simultaneously. How would I implement this while maintaining compatibility with the existing targeting code?",
    
    "input": null,
    
    "output": "Implementing multi-target Z-targeting requires careful modification of several core systems:

1. First, we need to extend the player state flags to track multiple targets:

```c
// Add to Player struct
struct {
    Actor* zTargets[MAX_TARGETS]; // Array of target pointers
    s16 targetCount;
    s16 currentTargetIdx;
} multiTarget;
```

2. Modify Player_UpdateZTarget() to handle multiple locks:
```c
void Player_UpdateZTarget(Player* player) {
    if (CHECK_BTN_ALL(input->press.button, BTN_Z)) {
        if (!(player->stateFlags1 & PLAYER_STATE1_Z_TARGETING)) {
            // Add new target if possible
            Actor* newTarget = Player_GetNearestTargetableActor(player);
            if (newTarget && player->multiTarget.targetCount < MAX_TARGETS) {
                player->multiTarget.zTargets[player->multiTarget.targetCount++] = newTarget;
                player->stateFlags1 |= PLAYER_STATE1_Z_TARGETING;
            }
        } else {
            // Cycle through existing targets
            player->multiTarget.currentTargetIdx = 
                (player->multiTarget.currentTargetIdx + 1) % player->multiTarget.targetCount;
        }
    }
}
```

3. Update the camera system to handle multiple focal points:
```c
void Camera_UpdateMultiTarget(Camera* camera, Player* player) {
    Vec3f averagePos = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < player->multiTarget.targetCount; i++) {
        averagePos.x += player->multiTarget.zTargets[i]->world.pos.x;
        averagePos.y += player->multiTarget.zTargets[i]->world.pos.y;
        averagePos.z += player->multiTarget.zTargets[i]->world.pos.z;
    }
    averagePos.x /= player->multiTarget.targetCount;
    averagePos.y /= player->multiTarget.targetCount;
    averagePos.z /= player->multiTarget.targetCount;
    
    Camera_LookAtPoint(camera, &averagePos);
}
```

The targeting system will need to be called from Player_Update() and properly integrate with the existing targeting logic.",

    "technical_notes": "- Requires careful memory management to avoid overflows
- Camera interpolation may need tweaking for smooth transitions
- Consider adding visual indicators for multiple targets
- May impact performance with too many simultaneous targets
- Needs hooks into combat system for multi-target attacks
