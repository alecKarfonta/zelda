# Fine-Tuning Language Models for Ocarina of Time Romhack Development: Comprehensive Strategy Report

- [ ] We should run a compiler to see if the generated code is actually works. 

Critical Issues Identified
Two major fabricated functions were discovered that do not exist in the authentic codebase:

DebugDisplay_AddObject - This function is completely fabricated and not found anywhere in the zeldaret/oot repository. No debug display functions matching this pattern exist.
MATRIX_NEWMTX - This macro does not exist in the authentic codebase. The correct alternatives are Matrix_NewMtx(play->state.gfxCtx, __FILE__, __LINE__) or MATRIX_FINALIZE_AND_LOAD. GitHub



## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** Fine-tuning a language model for Ocarina of Time romhacking is technically feasible using Unsloth, but requires creating a specialized dataset of instruction-response pairs covering C programming, N64 assembly, game engine architecture, and specific OoT modding techniques. The project would require approximately 3-6 months of data collection and curation, followed by iterative fine-tuning cycles.

**Key Requirements:**
- 5,000-50,000 high-quality instruction-response pairs
- Dataset formatted as question-answer pairs or conversational exchanges
- Coverage of C programming, MIPS assembly, actor scripting, and scene modification
- Access to decompiled OoT source code and existing romhack examples
- GPU with 8GB+ VRAM for efficient fine-tuning

## Unsloth Dataset Requirements

### Data Format Specifications

Unsloth requires datasets in specific formats, with the most common being instruction-response pairs or conversational chat templates. For romhack development, you have several formatting options:

#### 1. Alpaca Format (Recommended for Single-Turn Interactions)
```json
{
  "instruction": "Create a custom actor in Ocarina of Time that spawns a Cucco",
  "input": "The actor should appear in Kokiri Forest and respond to Z-targeting",
  "output": "Here's the C code for a custom Cucco actor:\n\n```c\n#include \"z64.h\"\n#include \"macros.h\"\n...\n```"
}
```

#### 2. ChatML Format (Recommended for Multi-Turn Conversations)
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "from": "human", 
      "value": "How do I modify Link's movement speed in Ocarina of Time?"
    },
    {
      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "To modify Link's movement speed, you need to edit the player actor. Here's how..."
    },
    {
      "from": "human",
      "value": "What about making this change only apply when wearing the Bunny Hood?"
    },
    {
      "from": "gpt", 
      "value": "For conditional speed changes, you'll need to check the equipped mask..."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Code-Focused Format
```json
{
  "instruction": "Explain this Ocarina of Time actor initialization function",
  "input": "```c\nvoid EnItem00_Init(Actor* thisx, GlobalContext* globalCtx) {\n    EnItem00* this = (EnItem00*)thisx;\n    s32 getItemId = thisx->params & 0xFF;\n    // ...\n}\n```",
  "output": "This function initializes a collectible item actor in OoT. The `params` field stores the item type in the lower 8 bits..."
}
```

### Dataset Size and Quality Requirements

Unsloth documentation emphasizes that dataset quality and amount largely reflect the end result of fine-tuning. For romhacking:

- **Minimum:** 5,000 instruction-response pairs
- **Recommended:** 15,000-25,000 pairs
- **Optimal:** 50,000+ pairs for comprehensive coverage

The quality is more important than quantity - well-structured question-answer pairs enhance learning, understanding, and response accuracy.
